### Project Overview

The aim of the project was to analyze sales performance across multiple regions to uncover revenue trends, cost structures, and profitability insights. Key Metrics analyzed were: Total Revenue, Total Cost, Profit Margins, Sales Volume, and Order Prioritization Impact. Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to track regional performance, sales trends, and high-profit items. Analyzing different aspects of the sales data enabled identification of top-performing regions, profitable product categories, and cost-saving opportunities. It also provided data-driven recommendations to optimize pricing strategies, inventory management, and sales channels.

### Data Sources

Sales data: The primary data used for this analysis is the “SalesReport.csv” file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company over a period time.

### Tools

- EXCEL – Data Cleaning
- Power BI – Visualizations and reports

### Data Cleaning

- Uploaded Dataset into Excel: Imported the raw sales dataset into Excel for initial preprocessing and data structuring.
- Changed Data Types: Ensured correct data types for each column (e.g., converting dates to Date format, numerical values to appropriate data types).
- Removed Duplicates: Identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity and accuracy.
- Handled Missing Values: Addressed null or incomplete data by applying appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.
- Standardized Formatting: Applied consistent formatting to dates, currency values, and categorical variables for uniformity.
- Removed Unnecessary Columns: Dropped irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis, improving dataset efficiency.
-	Added New Columns: Created calculated fields (e.g., Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost) to enhance analytical depth.


### EDA

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer questions such as:

1. What is the overall trend in sales revenue overtime (years)?
2. Which product categories generate the most revenue?
3. How does sales revenue vary by region or market segment?
4. What insights can be drawn from comparing high-performance vs low-performance channels or stores?
5. How do customer segments differ in terms of purchasing behavior and revenue contributions?

### Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.	High-Revenue Regions Identified: The top-performing regions generated the highest total revenue, with Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa leading in sales volume and profitability.
2.	Sales Channel Performance: Offline sales generally outperformed online sales in certain regions, while offline sales were dominant in others.
3.	Region-specific Insights: Sales patterns varied by country, with North America showing the lowest sales, profitability, or growth potential.
4.	Inventory Optimization Opportunities: Identified cosmetics were the best selling products and fruits were an under-performing product, enabling better stock management and demand forecasting.
5.	Revenue Trend: The revenue trend remained stable until 2015, after which it experienced a sharp decline through 2022.

### Recommendations

- Revamp Pricing Strategy: Adjust pricing for low-margin products like fruits to improve profitability while maintaining competitive market positioning.
- Boost High-Performing Product Sales: Focus marketing efforts on top-selling, high-margin items like cosmetics to maximize revenue growth.
- Strengthen Online Sales Channels: Expand digital marketing and e-commerce strategies to capitalize on the strong performance of online sales.
- Target High-Growth Regions: Invest resources in regions like Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa with strong sales performance while identifying and addressing challenges in underperforming markets like North America.

### Limitations

-  Lack of Customer Data: The dataset does not include customer demographics, preferences, or purchasing behavior, limiting insights into consumer trends.
-  No External Market Factors: The analysis does not account for economic conditions, competitor pricing, or market demand shifts that may have influenced sales.
- No Insights on Marketing Efforts: The impact of promotional campaigns, advertising strategies, and brand perception is not reflected in the data.
- Operational Costs Not Fully Captured: The dataset includes only unit cost but lacks details on logistics, storage, and other operational expenses affecting profitability.
- Limited Time Frame for Trend Analysis: The dataset covers a specific period, making it difficult to assess long-term industry trends or future projections.
- No Product-Specific Demand Drivers: The dataset does not provide information on factors influencing demand, such as seasonal trends, regional preferences, or competitor influence.
- Limited View of Order Fulfillment Efficiency: While shipping dates are included, there is no detailed breakdown of delays, logistics costs, or fulfillment bottlenecks.
